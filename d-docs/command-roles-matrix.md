## Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Product Owner → Developer (Direct)

**For small features without dedicated architect**

```
Product Owner:
  /speckit.specify → /speckit.clarify → /speckit.checklist (UX)

Developer:
  /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks → /speckit.analyze → /speckit.implement
```

---

### Pattern 2: Full Team Workflow (Complex Features)

**For large features with multiple stakeholders**

```
Product Owner:      /speckit.specify → /speckit.clarify
                           ↓
Business Analyst:   /speckit.checklist (requirements)
                           ↓
QA Engineer:        /speckit.checklist (testing)
Security Engineer:  /speckit.checklist (security)
                           ↓
Solution Architect: /speckit.plan
                           ↓
Tech Lead:          /speckit.tasks → /speckit.analyze
                           ↓
Scrum Master:       Sprint Planning (uses tasks.md)
                           ↓
Developer:          /speckit.implement
                           ↓
DevOps:             Deploy
```

---

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement

**When requirements evolve during development**

```
Developer discovers ambiguity:
  /speckit.clarify (with Product Owner)
     ↓
  spec.md updated
     ↓
  /speckit.tasks (regenerate affected tasks)
     ↓
  /speckit.implement (continue)
```

---

### Pattern 4: Quality-First Approach

**When quality gates are critical (regulated industries)**

```
Product Owner:      /speckit.specify
                           ↓
Multi-Role Review:  /speckit.checklist (multiple domains)
                    - UX checklist
                    - Security checklist
                    - Compliance checklist
                    - Performance checklist
                           ↓
GATE: All checklists must be 100% complete
                           ↓
Solution Architect: /speckit.plan
                           ↓
Tech Lead:          /speckit.tasks → /speckit.analyze
                           ↓
GATE: /speckit.analyze must show 0 critical issues
                           ↓
Developer:          /speckit.implement
                           ↓
GATE: All tests pass, security scan clean
                           ↓
DevOps:             Deploy
```

  → Defines principles:
    - "All services must be independently deployable"
    - "Services communicate via events (async)"
    - "Each service has its own database"
    - "OpenAPI specs for all service contracts"

Phase 1 - First Service:
  Product Owner: /speckit.specify "Extract user authentication into separate service"
  Solution Architect: /speckit.plan
  → research.md documents:
    - Service boundaries
    - Communication patterns
    - Data migration strategy

  Tech Lead: /speckit.analyze
  → Constitution Check:
    ✓ Independent deployment planned
    ✓ Event-based communication designed
    ✓ Separate database created
    ✓ OpenAPI specs included

Phase 2 - Implementation:
  Developer: /speckit.implement
  → Creates auth microservice

Phase 3 - Repeat for other services:
  → Each service follows same workflow
  → Constitution ensures consistency
```

## Best Practices by Role

### For Product Owners

1. **Start with `/speckit.specify`**: Don't write specs manually, let AI help
2. **Always run `/speckit.clarify`**: Answer questions to reduce downstream rework
3. **Use checklists early**: Catch issues before engineering starts
4. **Be specific**: Provide concrete examples in your feature descriptions
5. **Prioritize user stories**: P1, P2, P3 in spec.md drives task generation

---

### For Solution Architects

1. **Review spec before `/speckit.plan`**: Ensure requirements are clear
2. **Document decisions in research.md**: Explain why, not just what
3. **Use contracts/ for API-first**: Define interfaces before implementation
4. **Update constitution proactively**: Add principles as patterns emerge
5. **Validate with `/speckit.analyze`**: Ensure designs meet constitution

---

### For Tech Leads

1. **Run `/speckit.analyze` always**: Never skip pre-implementation validation
2. **Review dependency graph in tasks.md**: Identify critical path early
3. **Identify parallel work**: Maximize team throughput
4. **Use checklists for reviews**: Standardize quality expectations
5. **Track progress in tasks.md**: Mark tasks complete to show progress

---

### For Developers

1. **Read all artifacts before `/speckit.implement`**: Understand full context
2. **Trust the task order**: Dependencies are calculated automatically
3. **Mark tasks complete**: Update tasks.md as you finish work
4. **Use `/speckit.clarify` when stuck**: Don't guess, ask
5. **Follow the plan**: Resist urge to deviate from architecture

---

### For QA Engineers

1. **Create checklists early**: Before implementation starts
2. **Focus on testability in checklists**: Ensure requirements can be tested
3. **Use `/speckit.analyze`**: Validate coverage before testing
4. **Review acceptance criteria**: Every user story should have clear success metrics
5. **Participate in clarification**: Help Product Owners define testable requirements

---

### For Scrum Masters

1. **Use tasks.md for sprint planning**: Pre-broken down, dependency-aware
2. **Identify parallel streams**: Assign to different developers
3. **Track by user story**: Each story is an independent increment
4. **Monitor dependencies**: Use dependency graph to unblock team
5. **Measure by story completion**: Not individual tasks

## Conclusion

GitHub Spec Kit provides a complete workflow from specification to implementation, with clear role assignments:

1. **Product Owners** own requirements (specify, clarify)
2. **Architects** own technical design (plan, constitution)
3. **Tech Leads** own quality and execution (tasks, analyze)
4. **Developers** own implementation (implement)
5. **QA/Security/DevOps** own domain-specific validation (checklist)
6. **Scrum Masters** own process facilitation (tasks, planning)
7. **Engineering Managers** own governance (constitution)

**Key Principle**: Each role uses commands at the appropriate stage to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in the development process.
